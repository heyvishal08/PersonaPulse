# 🧠 PersonaPulse – Predictive Persona Strategy for E-Commerce

**PersonaPulse** is a full-stack data analytics and machine learning project designed to help e-commerce businesses understand customer behavior, identify high-value personas, and predict buyer intent. It combines SQL-based analysis, Power BI dashboards, and a buyer intent prediction model to deliver actionable business insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

PersonaPulse analyzes how customer personas influence buying behavior using:

- 🔍 **SQL**: RFM segmentation, Lifetime Value (LTV), and funnel drop-off analysis  
- 📊 **Power BI**: 5-page dashboard for KPIs, drop-offs, segmentation, and buyer insights  
- 🤖 **Python ML Model**: Random Forest classifier to predict purchase intent (89% accuracy)  

The goal is to improve marketing targeting, reduce returns, and drive smarter decisions through end-to-end data solutions.
